"\t\t\t<p>Benedikt Groß is a speculative and computational designer who "
"works antidisciplinary. His work deals with the fascination of "
"relationships between people, their data, technology and environments. He"
" is particular interested to speculate about these relationships in the "
"near future. He uses design as a vehicle to visualize potential "
"implications and scenarios. Benedikt's working mode can be described most"
" of the time as 'thinking through making', his preferred making material "
"is software.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>In 2013 he graduated of the Design Interactions course at the "
"Royal College of Art. He received the IxDA 2014 Best Student, the IxDA "
"2014 Best Concept and the Excellence Award of the Japanense Media Arts "
"Festival for his final RCA graduation projects, 'Avena+ Test Bed' and "
"'The Big Atlas of LA Pools'. He is co-author of 'Generative Design', "
"which was in 2010 one of the top selling German-language design books "
"with translations to English (Princeton Architectural Press) and French "
"(Design génératif, Editions Pyramid). It is considered being one of the "
"standard books in the field of computational design.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Benedikt’s work has been published in Wired, CAN, Form, Page, "
"Weave, Infosthetics etc. and also has been exhibited internationally at "
"the Japanense Media Arts Festival, the Open Data Institute, Ars "
"Electronica, V2_ & the New Institute and the Node Festival.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>He now lives in Stuttgart, Germany and tries to balance his time"

"projects. Currently he is also a visiting tutor for Digital Culture and "
"Data Visualization at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd.</p>"
